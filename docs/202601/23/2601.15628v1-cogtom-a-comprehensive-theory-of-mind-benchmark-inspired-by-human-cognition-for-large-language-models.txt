## Abstract 

Whether Large Language Models (LLMs) truly possess human-like Theory of Mind (ToM) capabilities has garnered increasing attention. However, existing benchmarks remain largely restricted to narrow paradigms like false belief tasks, failing to capture the full spectrum of hu-man cognitive mechanisms. We introduce Cog-ToM , a comprehensive, theoretically grounded benchmark comprising over 8000 bilingual in-stances across 46 paradigms, validated by 49 human annotator.A systematic evaluation of 22 representative models, including frontier mod-els like GPT-5.1 and Qwen3-Max, reveals sig-nificant performance heterogeneities and high-lights persistent bottlenecks in specific dimen-sions. Further analysis based on human cog-nitive patterns suggests potential divergences between LLM and human cognitive structures. CogToM offers a robust instrument and per-spective for investigating the evolving cognitive boundaries of LLMs. 

## 1 Introduction 

Theory of Mind (ToM) is fundamental to human social interaction, enabling us to represent and in-fer others’ mental states: for example, recogniz-ing a comment on room temperature as a veiled request to close a window. Since its first introduc-tion (Premack and Woodruff, 1978), psychologists have developed diverse paradigms to study this multifaceted cognitive capacity, including False Be-lief tasks (Perner et al., 1987; Wimmer and Perner, 1983), Faux Pas recognition (Baron-Cohen et al., 1999), and non-literal comprehension tasks like Strange Stories (Happé, 1994). As LLMs increasingly engage in social scenar-ios, evaluating their human-like ToM capabilities has become a central challenge. Early findings based on false-belief tasks(Le et al., 2019) sug-gested near-human proficiency (Kosinski, 2024).

However, these claims have been scrutinized due to models’ vulnerability to context perturbations, indi-cating a reliance on shallow pattern matching rather than genuine reasoning (Ullman, 2023; Shapira et al., 2024). Despite subsequent efforts to extend reasoning depth (Wu et al., 2023), introduce dia-logue scenarios (Kim et al., 2023) or incorporate diverse dimensions (Chen et al., 2024), existing benchmarks still lack the paradigm diversity com-pared with psychological research. Consequently, they fail to encompass the full cognitive spectrum or adequately characterize the potential discrepan-cies between machine and human intelligence. To bridge this gap, we introduce CogToM , a comprehensive ToM evaluation benchmark for LLMs inspired by human cognitive psychology. CogToM encompasses 46 task paradigms and com-prises over 8,000 bilingual (Chinese-English) in-stances, all of which have been meticulously an-notated and verified by multiple human experts. Distinguished by its substantial scale and excel-lent text and annotation quality, CogToM offers unprecedented task coverage by synergizing es-tablished evaluation tasks with newly introduced paradigms. We use CogToM to conduct a large-scale evalua-tion of 22 representative LLMs, spanning diverse release timelines, parameter scales, and model families, including frontier models such as GPT-5.1 and Qwen3-Max. The observed variance in performance across these models underscores the robust discriminative power of our benchmark. Furthermore, by integrating human-centric cogni-tive analyses, specifically the joint correlation be-tween model accuracy and human inter-annotator agreement rate (IAR), alongside an assessment of alignment with human developmental milestones, our findings suggest the potential presence of Moravec’s Paradox (Moravec, 1988) within the cognitive architectures of modern LLMs. This work makes the following key contributions:

• A Theoretically Grounded, Large-scale ToM Benchmark: We introduce CogToM , the most comprehensive ToM benchmark to date, featur-ing 46 task paradigms and 8,000+ expert-verified bilingual instances. • Large-scale Systematic Evaluation: Through a extensive evaluation of 22 representative LLMs, we provide a detailed landscape of current LLMs’ ToM ability boundaries, demonstrating our benchmark’s superior discriminative power. • Insights into Cognitive Heterogeneity: By eval-uating models against human-centric metrics and milestones, this study reveals fundamental dis-tinctions between LLMs and human ToM, offer-ing a critical perspective for understanding this cognitive divide. 

## 2 Related Works 

In the context of ToM evaluation of LLMs, story-based textual datasets play a pivotal role. As a early effort, ToMi established a systematic evalua-tion framework centered on false belief and second-order belief reasoning (Le et al., 2019), laying a pivotal foundation for subsequent ToM datasets and LLM evaluation paradigms. Following this, numerous benchmarks have sought to expand the false belief paradigm through diverse approaches, including the introduction of rich narrative stim-uli (Ma et al., 2023), dialogue-based interaction formats (Kim et al., 2023), higher-order reasoning depth (Wu et al., 2023), and complex knowledge-belief scenario constructions (Sileo and Lernould, 2023; Gu et al., 2024; Gandhi et al., 2023). Despite these effortss, such benchmarks remain essentially tethered to the false belief framework. Based on results from 40 crafted false belief tasks, Kosin-ski suggested that ToM may have spontaneously “emerged” in LLMs (Kosinski, 2024). However, this conclusion was subsequently challenged (Ull-man, 2023; Shapira et al., 2024), underscoring the inherent limitations of evaluating ToM capabilities through evaluation methods strictly confined to the false belief task paradigm. Subsequent research has sought to introduce more diverse cognitive dimensions to overcome the limitations of single-task evaluations. Strachan et al. employed five distinct ToM task types to assess LLMs (Strachan et al., 2024). EmoBench special-izes in the comprehensive evaluation of emotional reasoning (Sabour et al., 2024). Although Open-ToM (Xu et al., 2024) and NegotiationToM (Chan et al., 2024) formally resemble traditional false belief tasks, their underlying designs inherently in-corporate assessments across cognitive dimensions including emotiona, desire and intention. Drawing inspiration from the ATOMS framework (Beaudoin et al., 2020), ToMBench (Chen et al., 2024) further extends this coverage by adopting eight different task paradigms. Nevertheless, these benchmarks still remain largely constrained by narrow task paradigms and limited theoretical grounding. Con-sequently, they struggle to encompass the broad spectrum of human Theory of Mind or adequately characterize the potential cognitive discrepancies between LLMs and human intelligence. 

> Figure 1: Comparison of task coverage across different ToM benchmarks.

On the other hand, established and systematic psychological research provides a wealth of rigor-ously validated task paradigms encompassing di-verse cognitive dimensions. These established mea-sures range from the Tests of Emotion Comprehen-sion (TEC) (Pons and Harris, 2000) for affective understanding and the Yummy-yucky Task (Repa-choli and Gopnik, 1997) for probing subjective preferences, to the See-Know Task (Pillow, 1989) for analyzing perception-knowledge links, and Faux Pas Recognition (Baron-Cohen et al., 1999) for interpreting non-literal communication within complex social contexts. Consequently, to overcome the structural limita-tions of existing ToM benchmarks for LLMs, we draw upon these mature and extensively validated psychological paradigms to construct an entirely new evaluation dataset. Figure 1 visualizes the Figure 2: Overview of the CogToM framework. 

breadth of ToM task coverage, delineating the ex-panded scope of our dataset relative to previous evaluation frameworks. 

## 3 CogToM Framework 

We established CogToM, a human-cognition-inspired ToM evaluation framework for LLMs. This process involved summarizing psychological ToM paradigms and rewriting them into a standard-ized “scene-based multiple-choice” format suitable for LLMs. Combined with original assessment tasks and subjected to rigorous supervision and annotation by 49 individuals, the final benchmark encompasses 46 tasks and 8,513 data entries. 

3.1 Task Design 

Strictly adhering to the core definition of ToM (the ability to model the mental states of others and to distinguish them from one’s own), we established standards for task design, adaptation, and original creation. This process yielded 46 ToM tasks in a multiple-choice format (54-130 data groups per task, as shown in the right panel of Fig.2), such as 

False Belief Tasks [Location] , Scalar Implicature Task , Strange Stories [Lie] , and Test of Emotion Comprehension [Hidden Emotions] (square brack-ets denote categories subdivided based on inter-nal variations within the original paradigms). Fur-thermore, we mapped these tasks to ToM cogni-tive capabilities (referencing the ATOMS classifi-cation (Beaudoin et al., 2020)), summarizing them into 7 capability categories and 36 sub-capabilities (see Fig.2 and Appendix C.1). We summarize the principal contributions of our assessment frame-work as follows. 

Refinement of Classic Assessment Tasks. For ex-ample, we specifically revised the numerical stan-dards for options in the Scalar Implicature Task and the story logic of Strange Stories [Double Bluff] .Furthermore, for the Unexpected Outcome Task ,we shifted the assessment focus from atypical emo-tions to sequence false beliefs (see Table.33,39,40). 

Enhancement of Assessment Depth and Breadth. 

For instance, the newly introduced Naturalistic Sto-ries [2nd-Order False Belief] delves into higher-order beliefs and the revision of 2nd-Order false beliefs (see Table.37). Additionally, we adapted or created 5 comprehensive tasks that span diverse capabilities. Notably, the Strange Stories [Pretend] 

incorporates a contrast between pretend play and identity false beliefs (see Table.48). 

Four Original Assessment Paradigms. For in-stance, Expanding Tasks [Synesthetic Fallacy] (see Table.31), inspired by “The Blind Men and the Ele-Figure 3: The data construction pipeline of CogToM. 

phant,” evaluates whether the model understands that relying on a single sense to perceive multi-sensory objects can lead to cognitive misconcep-tions. 

Examination of Spatial Perspective Reconstruc-tion. The Spatial Construction Task focuses on evaluating the model’s perspective taking capabil-ities, specifically its ability to imagine perceptual information from another individual’s viewpoint (see Table.29). 

3.2 Construction of the CogToM Dataset 

The construction of our dataset proceeds through 6 stages, as illustrated in Fig. 3. Throughout this pro-cess, each data entry underwent at least 5 rounds of human supervision, simultaneously yielding struc-tured, high-quality task requirement specifications. 

3.2.1 Data Collection Task Collection and Adaptation. Based on psy-chological ToM assessment paradigms, we adapted one group of LLM evaluation data, wherein each data entry consists of one scene and 1-5 multiple-choice questions: • Scene situated within diverse social settings, the content was reconstructed based on original psy-chological assessment materials and is presented in a narrative format. • Question examines specific aspects of the scene. Within a single task, the number of questions per group is fixed, and questions with the same index maintain consistent inquiry formats. This design enables the assessment of the identical ToM capability across diverse social contexts. Each question corresponds exclusively to one ToM sub-capabilities. • Options serves as an extension of the question, each item consists of four options, only one of which is correct. Among incorrect choices, dis-tractors that closely resemble the correct option are included. 

3.2.2 LLM-based Question Expansion LLM Expansion Preparation. Building upon Stage 1, our expert team expanded each task to 5–10 data groups and formulated structured task specifications for the subsequent stages. 

LLM Automated Generation. We conducted pre-liminary interactions with LLMs to transform the outputs from Stage 2 into structured prompts (ex-amples provided in Appendix A.1 and Table.1). These prompts were then input into GPT-5.1 to gen-erate expanded data, ultimately resulting in 75–150 Chinese data groups per task. Expert 1 supervised this process, primarily verifying the formatting and ensuring that the generated scenes and questions met the task assessment requirements. 

Initial Check of LLM Expansion. Expert 2 re-viewed the supervision results and additionally as-sessed the richness of the scenes. If the data qual-ity was deemed substandard, the process reverted to Stage 3 for prompt regeneration. The roles of Expert 1 and Expert 2 were assumed by 6 core members of the research team on a rotating basis. 

3.2.3 Human Annotation and Data Validation High-quality Human Annotation. 42 graduate students (each paid with $30) specializing in Philos-ophy and Artificial Intelligence received training as detailed in Table.1 and Table.7-52. Subsequently, they rotated in the roles of Expert 3 and Expert 4 to perform a double-blind annotation of the outputs from Stage 4, focusing on answers and quality of the questions. Statistical data regarding the anno-tation process are presented in Appendix A.2 and Table.2. Final Dataset Completion. Expert 5 collected the annotation results. For data instances exhibiting discrepancies between human and answers by GPT-5.1 in Stage 3, or those flagged as “quality issues present” by annotators, Expert 5 consulted with the responsible Expert 3 and Expert 4 to revise or discard the items. Following further de-duplication, 54–130 data groups remained for each task. Finally, the dataset was translated into English using the Baidu API, supplemented by manual verification. 

## 4 Experimental Results and Analysis 

4.1 Experimental Setups 4.1.1 Evaluated Models 

We comprehensively evaluated a total of 22 representative models, spanning from early ver-sions released in July 2023 to the most re-cent state-of-the-art systems, covering multi-ple well-known open source and closed source series, including: GPT-3.5-Turbo (Ouyang et al., 2022), GPT-4o-2024-11-20 (Hurst et al., 2024), GPT-4o-mini (OpenAI, 2024), GPT-5.1 (OpenAI, 2025), Llama-2-7B-Chat (Touvron et al., 2023), Llama-2-13B-Chat (Touvron et al., 2023), Llama-3-8B-Instruct (Grattafiori et al., 2024), Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct (Meta AI, 2024), Mistral-7B-Instruct-v0.1 (Mistral AI, 2023a), Mixtral-8x7B-Instruct-v0.1 (Mistral AI, 2023b), Qwen-7B-Chat (Bai et al., 2023), Qwen1.5-7B-Chat (Team, 2024a), Qwen2-7B-Instruct (Yang et al., 2024), Qwen2.5-7B-Instruct (Team, 2024b), Qwen2.5-72B-Instruct (Team, 2024b), Qwen3-235B-A22B-Instruct (Yang et al., 2025), Qwen3-Max (Qwen Team, 2025a), Qwen3-Next-80B-A3B-Instruct (Qwen Team, 2025b), DeepSeek-v3 (Liu et al., 2024), DeepSeek-v3.2 (Liu et al., 2025), Grok-4-Fast (xAI, 2025), and Kimi-k2-0905 (Team et al., 2025). 

4.1.2 Evaluation Methods and Metrics 

We evaluate all the models using a zero-shot vanilla prompt, requiring them to output answers directly in the format of “[[Option Letter]]” (see Appendix A.3 for the full bilingual prompts). To ensure deterministic outputs and strict adherence to formatting requirements, we set the generation temperature to 0 for all models. To mitigate the impact of positional bias, each question is tested 5 times, comprising four cyclic rotations of the op-tions and one additional random shuffle distinct from the rotations. The average accuracy across these five trials serves as the primary evaluation metric. Given that the ground-truth labels in our dataset were established through multiple rounds of manual annotation and expert review, the accuracy also reflects the consistency rate between model selections and human expert judgments. 

4.2 Main Results 

Here we present the key experimental findings and provide a comprehensive analysis of our results. Given that the performance disparity between the Chinese and English datasets is marginal, the re-sults reported herein represent the aggregated mean across both languages unless otherwise specified. Detailed comparisons of cross-lingual performance variations are available in Appendix B.1. 

4.2.1 Temporal Evolution and Scaling Dynamics 

We begin by analyzing the average performance of various models across bilingual tests for all dif-ferent tasks. As illustrated in Figure 4, there is a pronounced upward trajectory in model capabilities over time. While early mainstream models, such as the Llama-2 series, exhibited accuracies within the 45%–55% range, frontier models by late 2025 (e.g., Qwen3-Max and GPT-5.1) have successfully surpassed 80%. 

> Figure 4: Overall average performance of open-source and closed-source models across various release dates, scales and families.

Consistent with the intuition provided by scal-ing laws (Kaplan et al., 2020), we observe that within the same model family and release win-dow, larger parameter counts directly correlate with higher accuracy (e.g., Llama-2-13B vs. 7B, and Qwen2.5-72B vs. 7B). Concurrently, a significant leap in parameter efficiency is evident. For in-stance, Qwen2.5-7B outperforms earlier, substan-tially larger architectures such as Llama-2-13B and Mixtral-8x7B. Furthermore, the performance gap between open-source and proprietary models is nar-rowing. Frontier open-source models exemplified by Qwen3-235B, now demonstrate accuracy levels that are comparable to, or even exceed, those of GPT-5.1. 

4.2.2 Differences Across ToM Cognitive Dimensions 

We delve deeper into the specific capabilities of models across 8 primary categories. As illustrated in Figure 5, LLMs exhibit significant heterogene-ity in performance across different ToM task cat-egories. Models demonstrate near-ceiling perfor-mance in Emotion , Desire , and Non-literal reason-ing tasks, with the majority of data points clustered between 80% and 95%. This suggests that modern LLMs have attained a high degree of proficiency in interpreting social-emotional context and linguistic nuances. 

> Figure 5: Accuracy distribution of models across differ-ent ToM task categories.

In contrast, the Percept category emerges as a critical performance bottleneck for all tested mod-els, with a median accuracy of only approximately 20%. This deficiency highlights the models’ in-herent struggle in resolving perspective disparity between the self and others, as well as their in-ability to perform robust perspective-taking to in-fer other’s observation of a shared environment. Furthermore, the high variance can be observed in Belief and Knowledge tasks, characterized by elongated violin bodies. This distribution implies that models have varying abilities in inferring the beliefs held by others or whether they can acquire certain knowledge, and a substantial gap remains between top-tier and mid-tier architectures. In con-clusion, while LLMs demonstrate near-human pro-ficiency in socio-affective semantic understanding, they continue to face fundamental hurdles in foun-dational cognitive reasoning linked to physical per-ception. 

4.2.3 Detailed Comparison across 46 Tasks 

We further examined their performance across 46 tasks. As illustrated in Figure 6, the bars represent the aggregate average accuracy of all tested models. The overlaying line plots depict the performance trajectories of four representative models selected to span a wide spectrum of capabilities: Llama-2-7B, Mixtral-8x7B, GPT-4o-mini, and Qwen3-235B. The comprehensive performance trajectories for all evaluated models are provided in the Appendix B.2. These results reveal a significant intra-category het-erogeneity in model performance, while the distinct trajectories of individual models further highlight the performance gaps and unique capability profiles of the evaluated models. While the Desire category (red bars) demon-strates high aggregate performance, granular anal-ysis uncovers a notable imbalance. Most models achieve near-ceiling accuracy in tasks like Multi-ple Desires (average accuracy approximately 95%), yet exhibit a marked degradation in the Yummy-yucky Task (average accuracy around 60%). Specif-ically, Mixtral-8x7B’s accuracy drops from near 100% in Multiple Desires to approximately 65% in the Yummy-yucky Task , while Llama-2-7B’s perfor-mance plummets to below 20%. In the Belief domain (orange bars), accuracy for second-order false belief and Unexpected Outcome Tasks is substantially lower than that for first-order tasks (about 15%), suggesting that increased cogni-tive complexity poses a significant hurdle. Within the Knowledge category (cyan bars), the perfor-mance on Reader’s Knowledge Aware is signifi-cantly higher, with an average accuracy of over 70%, compared to the Ex: Synesthetic Fallacy 

task, where the average accuracy is around 50%. This disparity suggests that the models’ proficiency in tracking a reader’s knowledge may stem from stylistic pattern matching or linguistic heuristics learned from explanatory corpora (Ullman, 2023; Shapira et al., 2024), rather than genuine ToM ca-pabilities. Conversely, the failure to resolve Ex: Synesthetic Fallacy , which involve foundational sensory common sense, underscores the models’ inherent difficulty in representing and reasoning about others’ perceptual states. Figure 6: LLMs’ performance across 46 tasks. Color of Bars indicate their respective primary categories. 

4.2.4 Discriminative Power of New Tasks 

Following our analysis of task performance vari-ance, we observed significant performance degrada-tions in specific tasks within the same primary abil-ity categories. Notable examples include Yummy-yucky Task in Desire , Ex: Harmful Intention in 

Intention , and Ex: Synesthetic Fallacy in Knowl-edge , etc. As illustrated in Figure 1, these challeng-ing tasks are the new task paradigms introduced in this study as opposed to existing benchmarks. Con-sequently, we partition the dataset into “Existing” and “New” categories to analyze the distribution of average item difficulty, defined as the mean accu-racy across all evaluated models for each individual question. A comprehensive list of “new tasks” is provided in Appendix A.4. 

> Figure 7: Density distribution of average model accu-racy for each question across existing and new tasks.

As illustrated in Figure 7, the existing tasks exhibit a pronounced ceiling effect, with density peaks heavily clustered around the 90%–100% ac-curacy range. This suggests that traditional ToM benchmarks are approaching saturation for current frontier models. In contrast, our newly proposed tasks display a significantly broader and more bal-anced distribution, with a substantial portion of questions falling within the 0%–60% low-to-mid accuracy bracket. This structural shift demonstrates that CogToM offers enhanced discriminative power and provides a more granular assessment of multi-faceted, sophisticated Theory of Mind capabilities. 

4.3 Indepth Analysis 4.3.1 Joint Analysis of Inter-annotator Agreement Rate and Model Accuracy 

To investigate the correlation between LLM perfor-mance and human cognitive patterns, we conducted a joint analysis of average model accuracy and hu-man inter-annotator agreement rate (IAR) across tasks. IAR, defined as the percentage of questions where two experts reach consensus when annotat-ing answers, serves as a metric for task difficulty for humans or its semantic ambiguity. As illustrated in Figure 8, each data point represents a specific task, with its marker shape and color denoting its corresponding ability category. We observe that most data points cluster within the y = x alignment zone, indicating a high de-gree of performance alignment between LLMs and human experts across these dimensions. Con-versely, the red elliptical region in the bottom-right corner reveals a profound cognitive asym-metry. While these tasks exhibit near-perfect hu-man consensus (IAR > 90%) and are considered unambiguous “common sense” by experts, aver-age model accuracy significantly degrades to the 30%–80% range. Especially, Percept tasks (in-dicated by purple crosses) reside at the very bot-tom. Despite 100% human agreement, model per-formance is abysmal, below 30%. This dispar-ity underscores the presence of Moravec’s Para-dox (Moravec, 1988) within LLM cognitive ar-chitectures. Notably, the vast majority of points within this red region correspond to our newly introduced task paradigms (highlighted with red outlines), demonstrating that CogToM effectively exposes critical vulnerabilities and delineates the true cognitive boundaries of LLM Theory of Mind. 

> Figure 8: Correlation between human Inter-annotator Agreement Rate (IAR) and average model accuracy across different tasks.

4.3.2 Assessment of Alignment with Human Developmental Milestones 

Psychological research indicates that the develop-ment of ToM in human children follows distinct, staged milestones. Specifically, children typically acquire basic subjective preference differentiation first, followed by the ability to judge others’ knowl-edge states based on perceptual cues, and finally, sophisticated reasoning regarding beliefs and com-plex emotions (Wellman and Liu, 2004b). We aim to investigate whether LLMs exhibit developmen-tal trajectories analogous to these human cognitive patterns. To this end, we have carefully selected a sequence of tasks that closely align with the estab-lished chronological developmental milestones of human ToM. As illustrated in Figure 9, selected task are ar-ranged chronologically from left to right (approx. 0–6 years), ranging from early-stage tasks like the 

Yummy-yucky Task to late-stage challenges such as TEC: Hidden Emotions . The bars indicate the accuracy of each model for the respective tasks. Our experimental results reveal a striking “de-velopmental inversion” in a considerable portion models. These models demonstrate near-human proficiency in late-acquired emotional reasoning, yet paradoxically fail at the most elementary sen-sory preference tests. For instance, Qwen-7B-Chat exhibits accuracies of 5%, 28%, 52%, 40%, 68%, 

> Figure 9: Accuracy of LLMs across the developmental sequence of ToM in human children.

and 71% across the sequenced tasks, demonstrat-ing a pronounced upward trajectory. Besides, even frontier models with superior overall performance exhibit an anomalous performance dip in the See-Know Task , a milestone typically mastered in early childhood. For example, GPT-5.1 achieves only 62% accuracy on this task, a significant degrada-tion compared to its near-perfect 96% on the more complex TEC: Hidden Emotions task .This suggests that LLMs likely achieve a form of “simulated ToM” through linguistic pattern match-ing and probabilistic prediction derived from mas-sive corpora, rather than through a cognitive de-velopmental process grounded in perception and embodiment as seen in humans. Ultimately, our analysis highlights the presence of Moravec’s Para-dox in LLM cognitive architectures: high-level cog-nitive capabilities are relatively accessible through scaling, whereas low-level perceptual reasoning remains challenging to replicate. 

## 5 Conclusion 

In this paper, we present CogToM , a theoreti-cally grounded benchmark that integrates 46 task paradigms. It offers comprehensive task coverage and demonstrates robust discriminative power. Ex-perimental results suggest that model performance is heterogeneous across different cognitive dimen-sions. Further analysis point toward potential diver-gences between machine intelligence and human cognitive patterns. In summary, CogToM offers a practical instrument and a new perspective for further investigating the cognitive boundaries of Theory of Mind in LLMs. Limitations 

Despite its comprehensive scope, several limita-tions of our work should be acknowledged. 

Linguistic and Cultural Scope: Currently, the benchmark is limited to Chinese and English. Con-sidering that ToM reasoning is deeply intertwined with linguistic structures and cultural norms, fu-ture work should expand to a broader range of lan-guages and cultural contexts. 

Modality Constraints: Many classic ToM evalua-tion paradigms, such as yoni task (Shamay-Tsoory and Aharon-Peretz, 2007) and animated triangle task (Abell et al., 2000), inherently rely on visual or dynamic cues. While we adapted these into tex-tual descriptions, this transition inevitably results in a loss of ecological validity compared to original psychological assessments. 

Evaluation Paradigm: CogToM primarily utilizes a multiple-choice format. While this ensures objec-tive scoring, it may not fully capture the generative and nuanced nature of ToM in open-ended social interactions. 

Static vs. Interactive Inference: Our tasks con-sist of static scenes. In real-world settings, ToM involves the recursive and dynamic updating of mental states during live interaction, a dimension that current single-turn evaluations cannot fully replicate.

## A Construction and Experiment Details 

A.1 Prompts for Data Expansion 

In Stage 3 of dataset construction, we utilized GPT-5.1 to expand the total number of scenes for 44 tasks. Taking Affective Perspective-taking Test as an example, we present the prompt used in the generation process, as shown in Table 1. It is worth noting that during the expansion of the 

Scalar Implicature Task and the Spatial Construc-tion Task using LLMs, three consecutive batches of generated results failed to pass the joint review by Expert 1 and Expert 2 due to fundamental and pervasive quality defects. Consequently, we ulti-mately did not employ Stages 3–6 described in the main text to expand the data for these two tasks. In the expansion process of the Scalar Implica-ture Task , while the story backgrounds generated by the LLM met the requirements, the model failed to produce satisfactory numerical values for the op-tions. Consequently, we retained over 100 scenes generated by the LLM. Expert 1 then individually reviewed each scene to revise the specific numer-ical values within the stories and further adjusted the option settings and correct answers according to our established standards. These results were finalized after verification by Expert 2. In the expansion process of the Spatial Construc-tion Task , the LLM was entirely unable to extend data with identical structures based on the provided examples. Therefore, using the 5 groups of exam-ple data as templates, we prompted the LLM to randomly generate object nouns and employed a batch processing script to replace the original nouns in the examples with these keywords, thereby gen-erating new data. 

A.2 Detials For Human Annotation 

In Stage 5 of dataset construction, we trained anno-tators Expert 3 and Expert 4 to label the quality and answers of the data. Quality was annotated as ei-ther “quality issues present” or “no quality issues”, based on the example questions and task require-ment descriptions for each task. Subsequently, in Stage 6, Expert 5 reviewed the annotation results and performed arbitration. Throughout this pro-cess, we calculated statistics for all tasks regard-你是一个 AI 助手，需要生成基于心理理 论（Theory of Mind ）的情绪问题。请严格参照以下 说明和示例，生成

We further investigated the impact of language on model performance through a cross-lingual eval-uation. As illustrated in Figure 10, the majority of evaluated models demonstrate nearly identical average performance across the bilingual test sets, indicating robust cross-lingual consistency. No-tably, for most contemporary models, the results in Chinese exhibit a marginal accuracy advantage. Conversely, for earlier architectures such as the Llama-2 and Mistral series, performance in English remains slightly superior.

## C Dataset Details 

C.1 Details of Theory-of-Mind Abilities 

We adopt the ATOMS framework from psychology to identify 36 social cognitive abilities spanning seven ability dimensions in our dataset, which are used for Theory of Mind (ToM) evaluation. We compared our work with 11 datasets, and the com-parison of capability assessment coverage is shown in Table 5. We categorized the dataset based on 36 ToM capabilities and compiled detailed statistics, as shown in Table 6. 

Emotion entails understanding how contextual fac-tors influence emotional states, recognizing the po-tential for experiencing complex emotions, and acknowledging the ability to regulate emotional expressions. This dimension comprises 9 capabili-ties. Notably, the ATOMS framework originally in-cludes a “Comprehensive measure involving emo-tion” that is difficult to quantify in isolation; there-fore, we decomposed this measure into capabilities (E8) and (E9) to capture aspects distinct from (E1) through (E7). (E1) Typical emotional reactions (Knafo et al., 2009): Inferring a person’s emotional reactions based on situations that typically elicit certain emo-tions/inferring a preceding event based on a per-son’s emotional reaction. (E2) Atypical emotional reactions (Denham, 1986): Inferring or explaining a person’s emotional reac-tions based on situations eliciting emotions that are atypical compared to what is usually expected. (E3) Discrepant emotions (Borke, 1971): Under-standing that people may have discrepant feelings about an event. (E4) Mixed emotions (Gordis et al., 1989): Under-standing that people may feel mixed emotions or different emotions successively. (E5) Hidden emotions (Harris et al., 1986): Under-standing that other people may hide their emotions. (E6) Moral emotions (Pons and Harris, 2000): Un-derstanding that negative feelings might arise fol-lowing a reprehensible action. (E7) Emotion regulation (Pons and Harris, 2000): Understanding that others might use strategies to regulate their emotions.
